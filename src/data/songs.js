It's just I'm constantly on the cusp of trying to kiss you\nI don't know if you feel the same as I do\nBut we could be together if you wanted to\n\n(Do I wanna know?)\nIf this feeling flows both ways?\n(Sad to see you go)\nWas sort of hoping that you'd stay\n(Baby, we both know)\nThat the nights were mainly made for saying things that you can't say tomorrow day\n\nCrawling back to you (crawling back to you)\n\nEver thought of calling when you've had a few?
